Design/Upload your floor plan and find the best spot for your Wi-Fi router.

## Problem Statement

I wanted to get a new Wi-Fi connection in my new apartment. But I since the rooms are quite spaced apart, it was difficult to figure out where the router should be placed to get good/average signal in all rooms. And I wanted to see if there are any apps/websites that can help me doing this. But, I couldn't find any that was free(I'm broke). So I decided to build one myself.
